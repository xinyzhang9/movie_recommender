# Movie Recommender using ReactiveX
> This is a movie recommender application based on ReactiveX concept. I create 3 streams to fetch movie data from API endpoints and each stream is considered as distinct. So the user can remove a single suggestion and it will be replaced by a new suggestion.

## Features
- [x] Render 3 response streams of suggested movies for user.
- [x] Cache fetched movie data to reduce API calls.
- [x] Save user's movie cart in local storage without using databases.
- [x] Add proper link to corresponding movie homepage.
